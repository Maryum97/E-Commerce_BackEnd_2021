## 🔍 Description
This repository contains another homework assignment conducted through the teaching facilities of the Univesity of Birmingham, in the Coding Bootcamp. It contains a software application by the name "E-Commerce BackEnd". This application has been created to serve the purpose of keeping track of the following, for a business:

- Category of items available for sales
- Products available in each category
- Tags for each product

The app allows the user to add, update, and delete any of the three aspects mentioned above, through the use of the right software tools on their server device.

## 💾 Installation
In order to install this app, the user must have all of the following installed and running on their local machines successfully:

1. Git bash (or terminal), to pull this app from Github
2. Visual Studio Code (VSC), to view the code
3. Node.js, to run the commands and inquirer prompts
4. MySQL Workbench, to run the database
5. XAMPP Control Panel, if user uses Windows, to 'Start' MySQL to connect in the Node terminal
6. Insomnia, to run the GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests locally

## ⚙️ Instructions
After having set up all of the above installations, the user must follow the instructions in the order below:

1. Windows users (make sure you open XAMPP and start the MySQL server)/MAC users (make sure you have your SQL server started)
2. Take the 2 lines from the db folder, schema.sql file and run them in MySQL Workbench (as shown in the video)
3. Make sure you run npm install in a terminal opened in your Unsolved folder
4. Rename the .env.EXAMPLE file to .env
5. Modify the .env file to have the DB_USER and DB_PASSWORD defined (make sure DB_NAME is also defined)
6. Run npm run seed (if that doesn't work check the seeds folder and see what is the filename that sends data to the database - it usually is called seed.js or index.js, once you find it, run node seeds/"filename", index.js in this case)
7. Run node server.js, and you are now done with node!
8. Move over to Insomnia, and create the files and requests in the left column, as shown in the video, and follow the next steps as the video demonstrates.

## ✏️ Tests
There were no particular test that this app has been made to pass, except for the app to flow error-free in the local terminal and in Insomnia, with all the correct packages and libraries installed, the database seeded, and the server running at all times of use.
